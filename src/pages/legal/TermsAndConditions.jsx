            <p>
                All visual designs, interface logic, and product representations are the exclusive intellectual property of Sartaaj Bharat. Reproduction or extraction of these artifacts without written protocol authorization is actionable.

            <p>
                Sartaaj Bharat provides its platform "as-is" for the modern lifestyle. While we strive for absolute precision in our manifest, we do not guarantee that every artifact description is error-free.
